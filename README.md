{EPITECH} | First year | Elementary programming in C project

You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.
The board is represented by a file passed as the program’s argument. 
The file is valid if it is respecting those constraints:

  - its first line contains the number of lines on the board (and only that),
  - “.” (representing an empty place) and “o” (representing an obstacle) are the only two characters for the other lines,
  - all of the lines are of the same length (except the first one),
  - it contains at least one line
  - each line is terminated by ‘\n’.
  
You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square you found.
